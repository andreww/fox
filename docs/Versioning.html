<h1>FoX versioning</h1>

<p>This documentation describes version 4.1 of the FoX library.</p>

<p>This version includes output modules for general XML, and for CML; and a fully validating XML parser, exposed through a Fortran version of the SAX2 input parser and a Fortran mapping of the W3C DOM interface.</p>

<p>This is a stable branch, which will be maintained with important bugfixes.</p>

<p><a name="Changes"/></p>

<h2>FoX Changes</h2>

<p>As of FoX-3.0, there is one user-visible change that should be noted.</p>

<h3>Configuration/compilation</h3>

<p>In previous versions of FoX, the configure script was accessible as <code>config/configure</code>. Version 3.0 now follows common practice by placing the script in the main directory, so it is now called as <code>./configure</code>.</p>

<p>Previous versions of FoX made it quite hard to compile only portions of the library (eg only the CML output portion; or just the SAX input). This is now possible by specifying arguments to the configuration script. For example,</p>

<p><code>./configure --enable-wcml</code></p>

<p>will cause the generated Makefile to only compile the CML writing module and its dependencies.</p>

<p>See <a href="Compilation.html">Compilation</a> for further details.</p>
